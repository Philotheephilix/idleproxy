# Hackathon Quickstart

A single copy-paste reference for the facts you need in the first thirty minutes: where the MCP endpoint is, which chains are supported, which USDC address and faucet to use, what the two API key types are for, and the rate limits. Each section links to its full reference page.

## 1\. Connect the MCP endpoint[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/quickstart#1-connect-the-mcp-endpoint)

The hosted MCP server is the fastest way to drive KeeperHub from an AI agent.

```
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user keeperhub https://app.keeperhub.com/mcp
```

Run `/mcp` in Claude Code to complete OAuth in the browser. For headless or CI environments, pass an organization API key instead:

```
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user keeperhub https://app.keeperhub.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer kh_your_key_here"
```

Every listed marketplace workflow is also reachable as its own typed MCP server at `https://app.keeperhub.com/mcp/w/<slug>`. See the [MCP Server](https://docs.keeperhub.com/ai-tools/mcp-server) reference for the full tool list and per-workflow details.

The endpoint URL is also shown, with a copy button, in the dashboard under **Settings -> API Keys**.

## 2\. Pick a key type[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/quickstart#2-pick-a-key-type)

KeeperHub has two key systems. They are not interchangeable.

| Prefix | Scope | Managed at | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kh_` | Organization | `/api/keys` | REST API, MCP server, Claude Code plugin |
| `wfb_` | User | `/api/api-keys` | Webhook trigger authentication |

For programmatic API and MCP access, use an organization (`kh_`) key. Full details: [API Keys](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/api-keys).

Confirm the key works before building on it:

```
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer kh_your_api_key" \
  https://app.keeperhub.com/api/keys
```

`GET /api/keys` is the auth probe: a `200` means the credential is valid and scoped to an organization, a `401` means it is not. Point health checks and first-run scripts at this endpoint. `GET /api/chains` is public and answers either way, so it reports reachability rather than a working credential.

No browser available? Sign-up is captcha-gated and key creation needs a signed confirmation, so a script or agent starts from wallet sign-in instead: [Headless Onboarding](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/headless-onboarding) is the same first thirty minutes without a UI.

## 3\. Supported chains[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/quickstart#3-supported-chains)

Status reflects support maturity: **stable** chains are production-ready; **experimental** chains are accepted but may behave unreliably (for example, broadcasts can hang) and should not be used for production writes without opting in explicitly.

Start on a testnet. Fund the wallet with native gas first, then test USDC. The wallet to fund is the organization wallet reported by `GET /api/user`, not the address a wallet user signed in with - see [Headless Onboarding](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/headless-onboarding#3-the-wallet-to-fund-is-not-the-wallet-you-signed-in-with).

### Testnets (recommended for hacking)[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/quickstart#testnets-recommended-for-hacking)

| Network | chainId | USDC | Faucets | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ethereum Sepolia | `11155111` | `0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238` | [ETH](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia) , [USDC](https://faucet.circle.com/)  | stable |
| Base Sepolia | `84532` | `0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e` | [ETH](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/faucet) , [USDC](https://faucet.circle.com/)  | stable |

### Mainnets[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/quickstart#mainnets)

| Network | chainId | USDC | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ethereum | `1` | `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` | stable |
| Base | `8453` | `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` | stable |
| Arbitrum One | `42161` | `0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831` | stable |
| Optimism | `10` | `0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85` | stable |
| Polygon | `137` | `0x3c499c542cEF5E3811e1192ce70d8cC03d5c3359` | stable |

### Experimental[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/quickstart#experimental)

| Network | chainId | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0G | `16661` | experimental |
| 0G Galileo (testnet) | `16602` | experimental |

The live source of truth for chains is `GET /api/chains`; agents can read the same list (including per-chain `status`) from the `list_action_schemas` MCP tool. Faucet links are third-party and may change. See the full [Chains](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/chains) reference for chain-name aliases and ABI fetching.

## 4\. Rate limits[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/quickstart#4-rate-limits)

| Context | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Authenticated requests | 100 / minute |
| Unauthenticated requests | 10 / minute |
| Direct execution (per API key) | 60 / minute |

Rate-limited requests return `429` with a `Retry-After` header. See [Direct Execution](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/direct-execution) for spending caps.

## 5\. Sandbox[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/quickstart#5-sandbox)

The Code action runs untrusted JavaScript in an isolated `node:vm` sandbox with outbound SSRF protection. See [Code Plugin](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/code) for what is allowed and blocked.

## 6\. Send your first transaction safely[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/quickstart#6-send-your-first-transaction-safely)

The MCP direct execution tools let an agent preflight and broadcast without switching to a separate API client. Start with a testnet wallet funded from the faucets above, then use this sequence:

1.  Call `execute_transfer` with `simulate: true`.
2.  Continue only when the result has `success: true` and `wouldRevert: false`.
3.  Repeat the same call with `simulate` omitted and a new `idempotency_key`.
4.  Pass the returned `executionId` to `get_direct_execution_status` and poll until the status is `completed` or `failed`. Wait the number of seconds in the `X-Poll-Interval-Hint` response header between polls rather than picking your own interval; a value of `0` means the execution is terminal and you can stop.
5.  Save `transactionLink` from the terminal response as the onchain proof.

Example simulation on Base Sepolia:

```
{
  "chain_id": "84532",
  "to_address": "0xRecipient",
  "amount": "0.01",
  "simulate": true
}
```

For an ERC-20 transfer, also pass the token’s contract address as `token_address`. The Base Sepolia USDC address is listed in the table above. Any MCP tool error is a failed preflight and must stop the flow; revert details include the REST error JSON when available. Simulation is currently EVM-only, so `execute_transfer` rejects `simulate: true` for Solana chain IDs `101` and `103` and their aliases before making an API call. See [MCP Server](https://docs.keeperhub.com/ai-tools/mcp-server#safely-preflight-direct-writes) for the tool flow and [Direct Execution](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/direct-execution) for complete response and error handling details.
