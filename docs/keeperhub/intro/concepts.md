# Core Concepts

# Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you get the most out of KeeperHub.

## Workflows[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/intro/concepts#workflows)

Workflows are visual automations that you build by connecting nodes on a canvas. Each workflow represents a complete automation - from trigger to actions.

**Key characteristics:**

-   Visual, node-based design
-   Automatic or manual execution
-   Conditional branching for complex logic
-   Shareable via the Hub

## Nodes[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/intro/concepts#nodes)

Nodes are the building blocks of workflows. Each node performs a specific function.

### Trigger Nodes[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/intro/concepts#trigger-nodes)

Every workflow starts with a trigger that determines when it runs:

-   **Scheduled**: Run at intervals (every 5 minutes, hourly, daily)
-   **Webhook**: Run when an external service calls your workflow URL
-   **Event**: Run when a blockchain event is detected
-   **Block**: Run at blockchain block intervals on a specific chain
-   **Manual**: Run only when you click the Run button

### Action Nodes[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/intro/concepts#action-nodes)

Actions perform the actual work in your workflow:

-   **Web3 Actions**: Check Balance, Read Contract, Write Contract, Transfer Funds
-   **Notification Actions**: Send Email, Send Discord Message, Send Slack Message
-   **Integration Actions**: Send Webhook, custom HTTP requests

### Condition Nodes[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/intro/concepts#condition-nodes)

Conditions evaluate data and create branching paths:

-   **Low Balance Condition**: Check if balance is below threshold
-   **Value Comparison**: Compare any value against a target
-   **Custom Logic**: Combine conditions with AND/OR operators

## Connections[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/intro/concepts#connections)

Connections store credentials for external services. Set up connections once and reuse them across workflows.

**Connection types:**

-   **Web3**: Wallet connections for blockchain operations
-   **Email**: Email provider configuration
-   **Discord**: Webhook URLs for Discord channels
-   **Slack**: Bot token
-   **Telegram**: Bot token from BotFather
-   **Webhook**: Custom HTTP endpoint credentials

## Workflow Runs[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/intro/concepts#workflow-runs)

Each time a workflow executes, it creates a run with detailed logging:

-   **Status**: Pending, Running, Completed, Failed, Cancelled
-   **Node Outputs**: Results from each node in the workflow
-   **Timing**: Start time, duration, completion time
-   **Errors**: Detailed error messages if something fails

## The Hub[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/intro/concepts#the-hub)

The Hub is a marketplace for workflow templates:

-   **Browse**: Discover workflows shared by the community
-   **Import**: Copy workflows to your account
-   **Share**: Publish your workflows for others to use

## AI Assistant[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/intro/concepts#ai-assistant)

KeeperHub includes an AI assistant to help you build workflows:

-   Describe what you want in plain language
-   The AI suggests nodes and configurations
-   Review and customize the generated workflow

Access the AI via the “Ask AI…” input at the bottom of the canvas.

## Turnkey Wallet[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/intro/concepts#turnkey-wallet)

Every KeeperHub organization includes a Turnkey wallet:

-   **Automatic provisioning**: Created once your email is verified
-   **Secure custody**: Private keys are generated and held inside secure hardware enclaves (TEEs)
-   **Key export**: Export your private key at any time to migrate elsewhere
-   **Funding**: Top up with ETH to enable gas-consuming operations
-   **Management**: View balance, withdraw funds, and export your key via Settings > Wallet

## Networks[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/intro/concepts#networks)

KeeperHub supports a range of EVM chains, including:

-   **Ethereum Mainnet**: Production network for real transactions
-   **Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon**: Layer 2 and sidechain networks with lower gas fees
-   **BNB Chain, Avalanche, and others**: Additional supported mainnets
-   **Testnets** (Sepolia, Base Sepolia, and more): For development with free test tokens

The authoritative, up-to-date list is available from `GET /api/chains`.

Always test workflows on a testnet before deploying to Mainnet.
