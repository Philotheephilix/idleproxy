# Access Control

# Access Control

KeeperHub organizations use three roles: **owner**, **admin**, and **member**. The role controls who can perform sensitive account, wallet, and security actions. Day-to-day workflow collaboration is shared across all members.

## Personal Workspace[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/users-teams-orgs/permissions#personal-workspace)

In your personal workspace you have full control:

-   Full control over all workflows you create
-   Complete access to run history
-   Management of notification connections
-   API key generation and management

## Organization Roles[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/users-teams-orgs/permissions#organization-roles)

### Member[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/users-teams-orgs/permissions#member)

Every organization member can collaborate on the organization’s workflows:

-   View all organization workflows
-   Create, edit, and delete workflows
-   Enable and disable workflows
-   View run history for all workflows

### Admin[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/users-teams-orgs/permissions#admin)

Admins have every member permission plus organization key management:

-   Create and revoke organization (`kh_`) API keys
-   View the organization’s security audit trail

### Owner[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/users-teams-orgs/permissions#owner)

The owner has full control, including the most sensitive wallet and security actions:

-   Withdraw funds from the organization wallet
-   Export the wallet private key
-   Export the security audit trail
-   Everything admins and members can do

The user who creates an organization becomes its owner. Ownership can be transferred to another accepted member, for example when the sole owner leaves the organization.

## Audit Trail[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/users-teams-orgs/permissions#audit-trail)

Owners and admins can view the organization’s security audit trail. It records sensitive actions (member changes, API key creation and revocation, wallet approvals, and settings changes) with the acting user and a timestamp.

## Step-Up Verification[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/users-teams-orgs/permissions#step-up-verification)

Sensitive owner actions such as withdrawing funds, exporting the wallet key, and exporting the audit trail require step-up verification (a second factor) in addition to the role check.

## Security Considerations[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/users-teams-orgs/permissions#security-considerations)

-   Organization members share access to workflows, which can execute transactions from the organization wallet. Be cautious about who you invite to organizations with funded wallets.
-   Fund withdrawal, key export, and audit export are restricted to the owner.
-   Keep critical wallet operations in organizations with a small, trusted membership.
