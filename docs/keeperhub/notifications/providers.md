## Using Connections in Workflows[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/notifications/providers#using-connections-in-workflows)

After setting up connections, use them in notification nodes:

1.  Add a notification node to your workflow (Send Email, Send Discord Message, etc.)
2.  Click the node to open configuration
3.  Select your connection from the **Connection** dropdown
4.  Configure the message content

### Connection Status[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/notifications/providers#connection-status)

The configuration panel shows connection status:

-   **Green checkmark**: Connection is valid and ready
-   **Red indicator**: Connection needs attention (expired, invalid credentials, etc.)

## Dynamic Variables in Messages[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/notifications/providers#dynamic-variables-in-messages)

Include workflow data in your notifications using template references to earlier nodes:

```
{{@nodeId:Label.field}}
```

Each node’s outputs become available to downstream nodes. For example, a Check Balance node labeled “Check Balance” exposes `{{@checkBalance:Check Balance.balance}}` and `{{@checkBalance:Check Balance.address}}`. See [Templating](https://docs.keeperhub.com/workflows/templating) for the full syntax and available fields.

**Example Discord Message:**

```
Balance Alert: Wallet {{@checkBalance:Check Balance.address}} now has {{@checkBalance:Check Balance.balance}} ETH
```

## Best Practices[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/notifications/providers#best-practices)

### Redundancy[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/notifications/providers#redundancy)

Configure multiple notification channels for critical workflows. If one channel fails, others will still deliver.

### Testing[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/notifications/providers#testing)

Test your connections after setup using a simple workflow with a manual trigger.

### Security[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/notifications/providers#security)

-   Use HTTPS for all webhook URLs
-   Avoid including sensitive data (private keys, passwords) in notification messages
-   Regularly review and rotate webhook URLs if compromised

### Channel Organization[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/notifications/providers#channel-organization)

-   Use dedicated Discord/Slack channels for KeeperHub alerts
-   Consider separate channels for different workflow types (alerts, transactions, monitoring)
