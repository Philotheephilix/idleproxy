# Node Configuration

# Node Configuration

This guide covers how to configure nodes in the KeeperHub workflow builder.

## Configuration Panel[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/keepers/configuration#configuration-panel)

Click any node on the canvas to open its configuration panel on the right side of the screen. The panel shows all available settings for that node type.

### Required Fields[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/keepers/configuration#required-fields)

Fields marked with an asterisk (\*) are required. The workflow cannot run until all required fields are completed.

### Common Fields[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/keepers/configuration#common-fields)

All nodes share these configuration options:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Label | Display name shown on the node (e.g., “Check Balance”) |
| Description | Optional notes about what this node does |
| Enabled | Toggle to activate or deactivate this node |

## Trigger Configuration[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/keepers/configuration#trigger-configuration)

### Scheduled Trigger[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/keepers/configuration#scheduled-trigger)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Interval | How often the workflow runs |
| Options | Every 5 minutes, 15 minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, or custom cron |

**Custom Cron**: Enter a cron expression for precise scheduling (e.g., `0 9 * * 1-5` for weekdays at 9 AM).

### Webhook Trigger[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/keepers/configuration#webhook-trigger)

| Field | Description |

KeeperHub automatically fetches the contract ABI from block explorers. For proxy contracts, it detects the proxy pattern and fetches the implementation ABI automatically. Supported proxy standards include EIP-1967, EIP-1822 (UUPS), OpenZeppelin Transparent Proxy, EIP-1167 (minimal proxy), and Gnosis Safe. For EIP-2535 Diamond contracts, KeeperHub queries the Diamond Loupe interface to discover all facets and combines their ABIs into a single unified interface.

| --- | --- |
| Service | Web3 |
| Connection \* | Wallet connection for signing |
| Network \* | Target blockchain network |
| Contract Address \* | Smart contract address |

| Parameters | Function input parameters |
| Gas Limit | Optional gas limit override |

**Important**: Write operations require ETH in your Turnkey wallet for gas fees.

## Managing Connections[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/keepers/configuration#managing-connections)

Connections store credentials for external services. Set them up before configuring nodes that require them.

### Adding a Connection[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/keepers/configuration#adding-a-connection)

1.  Click your profile icon in the top-right corner
2.  Select **Connections**
3.  Click **Add Connection**
4.  Choose the connection type
5.  Enter the required credentials
6.  Save the connection

### Connection Types[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/keepers/configuration#connection-types)

| Type | Required Information |
| --- | --- |
| Web3 Wallet | Wallet address (Turnkey wallet auto-connected) |
| Email | Provider API key |
| Discord | Webhook URL |
| Slack | Bot token (starts with `xoxb-`) |
| Telegram | Bot token from BotFather |
| Webhook | URL and authentication headers |

### Using Connections in Nodes[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/keepers/configuration#using-connections-in-nodes)

When configuring a node:

1.  Select the **Connection** field
2.  Choose from your saved connections
3.  The connection status shows as a green checkmark if valid

## Dynamic Variables[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/keepers/configuration#dynamic-variables)

Reference data from earlier nodes in notification messages, condition expressions, and action parameters using template references:

```
{{@nodeId:Label.field}}
```

For example, a Check Balance node labeled “Check Balance” exposes its result as `{{@checkBalance:Check Balance.balance}}`. See [Templating](https://docs.keeperhub.com/workflows/templating) for the full syntax and available fields.

**Example Message:**

```
Balance Alert: {{@checkBalance:Check Balance.address}} has {{@checkBalance:Check Balance.balance}} ETH
```

## Enabling and Disabling Nodes[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/keepers/configuration#enabling-and-disabling-nodes)

Each node has an **Enabled** toggle:

-   **Enabled**: Node executes when the workflow runs
-   **Disabled**: Node is skipped during execution

This allows you to temporarily disable parts of a workflow without deleting them.

## Deleting Nodes[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/keepers/configuration#deleting-nodes)

Click the **Delete** button at the bottom of the configuration panel to remove a node. This also removes all connections to and from that node.
