# Aave V4

# Aave V4

Aave V4 introduces a Hub-and-Spoke architecture: liquidity lives in Hubs, while users supply, borrow, and manage collateral through Spokes tied to specific ecosystems. Each Spoke has its own set of reserves identified by an opaque `reserveId`, resolved from an asset via the Hub address and the Hub’s asset ID. Aave V4 uses a single rate model per reserve, so there is no separate stable/variable borrow mode as in Aave V3.

This plugin currently exposes the Lido Spoke, one of Aave V4’s launch Spokes. Additional Spokes can be added as the protocol matures.

Supported chains: Ethereum. Read-only actions work without credentials. Write actions require a connected wallet.

## Supply Asset[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/aave-v4#supply-asset)

Supply an asset to the Aave V4 Lido Spoke to earn interest. Amount is in the underlying asset’s smallest unit (wei for 18-decimal tokens).

**Inputs:**

| Input | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reserveId | uint256 | Reserve ID (resolve first with Get Reserve ID) |
| amount | uint256 | Amount (wei) |
| onBehalfOf | address | On Behalf Of Address |

**Outputs:** `success`, `transactionHash`, `transactionLink`, `error`

**When to use:** Earn yield on idle tokens, automate deposits into the Lido Spoke, build supply strategies keyed off reserve identifiers.

* * *

## Withdraw Asset[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/aave-v4#withdraw-asset)

Withdraw a supplied asset from the Aave V4 Lido Spoke.

| onBehalfOf | address | Recipient Address |

**Outputs:** `success`, `transactionHash`, `transactionLink`, `error`

**When to use:** Withdraw funds when needed, automate withdrawals based on rate changes, rebalance collateral positions.

* * *

## Borrow Asset[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/aave-v4#borrow-asset)

Borrow an asset from the Aave V4 Lido Spoke against supplied collateral. V4 uses a single rate model, so there is no interest rate mode input.

**Inputs:**

| Input | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reserveId | uint256 | Reserve ID |
| amount | uint256 | Amount (wei) |
| onBehalfOf | address | On Behalf Of Address |

**Outputs:** `success`, `transactionHash`, `transactionLink`, `error`

**When to use:** Borrow against collateral, leverage positions, automate borrowing based on market conditions.

* * *

## Repay Debt[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/aave-v4#repay-debt)

Repay a borrowed asset to the Aave V4 Lido Spoke.

**Inputs:**

| Input | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reserveId | uint256 | Reserve ID |
| amount | uint256 | Amount (wei) |
| onBehalfOf | address | On Behalf Of Address |

**Outputs:** `success`, `transactionHash`, `transactionLink`, `error`

**When to use:** Automate debt repayment when health factor drops, repay before liquidation, scheduled debt reduction.

* * *

## Set Asset as Collateral[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/aave-v4#set-asset-as-collateral)

Enable or disable a supplied reserve as collateral in the Aave V4 Lido Spoke. There is no partial collateral in V4: this toggles the entire supplied balance of the reserve.

**Inputs:**

| Input | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reserveId | uint256 | Reserve ID |
| usingAsCollateral | bool | Use as Collateral |
| onBehalfOf | address | On Behalf Of Address |

**Outputs:** `success`, `transactionHash`, `transactionLink`, `error`

**When to use:** Manage collateral exposure, disable a reserve as collateral during market uncertainty, optimize borrow capacity.

* * *

## Get Reserve ID[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/aave-v4#get-reserve-id)

Resolve an asset to its `reserveId` within the Lido Spoke, given the Hub address and the Hub’s asset ID for that asset. Call this before Supply, Withdraw, Borrow, Repay, or Set Asset as Collateral.

**Inputs:**

| Input | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hub | address | Hub Address |
| assetId | uint256 | Hub Asset ID (resolve via the Hub’s `getAssetId(underlying)`) |

**Outputs:**

| Output | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reserveId | uint256 | Reserve ID |

**When to use:** Look up the reserveId for a token before running any Spoke action against it.

* * *

## Get User Supplied Assets[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/aave-v4#get-user-supplied-assets)

Get the amount of underlying asset supplied by a user for a given reserve.

**Inputs:**

**Outputs:**

| Output | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| suppliedAmount | uint256 | Supplied Amount (underlying) |

**When to use:** Monitor individual reserve positions, track supplied balances across reserves.

* * *

## Get User Debt[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/aave-v4#get-user-debt)

Get the debt of a user for a given reserve, split into drawn debt and premium debt. Total debt is drawn plus premium.

**Inputs:**

| Input | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Output | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| accountData | struct | riskPremium, avgCollateralFactor, healthFactor, totalCollateralValue, totalDebtValueRay, activeCollateralCount, borrowCount |

## Example Workflows[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/aave-v4#example-workflows)

### Health Factor Monitor with Alert[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/aave-v4#health-factor-monitor-with-alert)

`Schedule (every 5 min) -> Aave V4: Get User Account Data -> Code (accountData.healthFactor / 1e18) -> Condition (< 1.5) -> Discord: Send Message`

Monitor your Aave V4 Lido Spoke health factor and send a Discord alert when it drops below 1.5, giving you time to act before liquidation.

### Supply After Resolving Reserve ID[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/aave-v4#supply-after-resolving-reserve-id)

`Manual -> Aave V4: Get Reserve ID -> Aave V4: Supply Asset`

Resolve the reserveId for an asset from its Hub address and asset ID, then supply that asset to the Lido Spoke in the same workflow.
