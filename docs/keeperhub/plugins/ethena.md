# Ethena

Ethena is the protocol behind USDe, a synthetic dollar, and sUSDe, an ERC-4626 vault that stakes USDe to earn protocol yield. Exiting sUSDe normally goes through a cooldown period: initiate a cooldown for a specific asset or share amount, wait for the cooldown duration to elapse, then unstake to claim the underlying USDe. This plugin also exposes balance checks for the USDe stablecoin and the ENA governance token.

Supported chains: Ethereum. Read-only actions work without credentials. Write actions require a connected wallet.

## Actions[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/ethena#actions)

Actions are grouped below by contract: the sUSDe staking vault, the USDe stablecoin, and the ENA governance token.

### sUSDe Staking Vault[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/ethena#susde-staking-vault)

| Vault Mint | `vault-mint` | Write | Mint exact sUSDe shares by depositing the required amount of USDe |
| Vault Withdraw | `vault-withdraw` | Write | Withdraw USDe from the vault by specifying asset amount |
| Vault Redeem | `vault-redeem` | Write | Redeem sUSDe shares for USDe |

| Preview Vault Redeem | `vault-preview-redeem` | Read | Preview how much USDe a given share redemption would yield |
| Max Vault Deposit | `vault-max-deposit` | Read | Get the maximum USDe amount that can be deposited for a receiver |

| Cooldown Assets | `cooldown-assets` | Write | Initiate the cooldown period to unstake a specific amount of USDe |

## Example Workflows[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/ethena#example-workflows)

### Auto-Stake Idle USDe[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/ethena#auto-stake-idle-usde)

`Schedule (hourly) -> Ethena: Get USDe Balance -> Math (Sum, divide by 1e18) -> Condition (> 100) -> Ethena: Approve USDe Spending -> Ethena: Vault Deposit`

Check for idle USDe and stake it into sUSDe when the balance exceeds a threshold.

### Cooldown and Unstake Pipeline[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/ethena#cooldown-and-unstake-pipeline)

`Manual -> Ethena: Cooldown Shares -> Ethena: Get Cooldown Status -> Condition (cooldownEnd elapsed) -> Ethena: Unstake`

Start a cooldown on a share amount, monitor its status, and unstake once the cooldown period has elapsed.
