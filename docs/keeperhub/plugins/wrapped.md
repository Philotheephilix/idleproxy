# Wrapped

# Wrapped

Many DeFi protocols require an ERC-20 token rather than a chain’s native asset. This plugin wraps a chain’s native token (ETH, BNB, MATIC, or AVAX depending on the chain) into its 1:1 wrapped ERC-20 form, and unwraps it back to the native token. The contract used is whichever wrapped-native token is canonical for the selected chain, for example WETH on Ethereum, Base, and Arbitrum.

Supported chains: Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and Sepolia (WETH), plus Base Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia testnets. The underlying integration also covers BNB Smart Chain and BNB Testnet (WBNB), Polygon (WMATIC), and Avalanche C-Chain and Fuji testnet (WAVAX); the chain selector restricts to whichever of these are configured for your workflow. Read-only actions work without credentials. Write actions require a connected wallet.

## Actions[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/wrapped#actions)

| Action | Type | Credentials | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wrap Native Token | Write | Wallet | Wrap the chain’s native token into its wrapped ERC-20 form |
| Unwrap Wrapped Token | Write | Wallet | Unwrap the wrapped token back to the chain’s native token |
| Check Wrapped Token Balance | Read | No | Read the wrapped token balance of an address on the selected chain |

## Wrap Native Token[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/wrapped#wrap-native-token)

Wrap the chain’s native token into its wrapped ERC-20 form. Send native token value with the transaction; the contract mints an equal amount (1:1) of the wrapped token to the sender.

**Inputs:** Native token amount is sent as the transaction’s ETH value (no separate amount input).

**Outputs:** `success`, `transactionHash`, `transactionLink`, `error`

**When to use:** Prepare native token for use in DeFi protocols that only accept ERC-20 tokens, fund a SuperToken wrap, provision liquidity that expects a wrapped-token deposit.

* * *

## Unwrap Wrapped Token[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/wrapped#unwrap-wrapped-token)

Unwrap the wrapped token back to the chain’s native token. The contract burns the specified amount of wrapped token and sends an equal amount of native token to the sender.

**Inputs:**

| Input | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wad | uint256 | Amount (wei) of wrapped token to burn; an equal amount of native token is sent back to your address |

**Outputs:** `success`, `transactionHash`, `transactionLink`, `error`

**When to use:** Convert wrapped-token balances back to native token for gas, exit a position that ends in the wrapped token, consolidate holdings into native token.

* * *

## Check Wrapped Token Balance[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/wrapped#check-wrapped-token-balance)

Read the wrapped token balance of an address on the selected chain.

**Inputs:**

| Input | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| account | address | Wallet Address |

**Outputs:**

| Output | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| balance | uint256 | Wrapped Token Balance (wei), 18 decimals |

**When to use:** Verify a wrap or unwrap succeeded, monitor wrapped-token holdings before running a downstream DeFi action.

## Example Workflows[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/wrapped#example-workflows)

### Wrap Then Supply[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/wrapped#wrap-then-supply)

`Manual -> Wrapped: Wrap Native Token -> Wrapped: Check Wrapped Token Balance -> Aave V3: Supply Asset`

Wrap native ETH into WETH, confirm the balance credited, then supply it into a lending protocol that requires an ERC-20.

### Unwrap on Withdrawal[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/wrapped#unwrap-on-withdrawal)

`Aave V3: Withdraw Asset -> Wrapped: Unwrap Wrapped Token -> Discord: Send Message`

After withdrawing a wrapped-token position from a lending protocol, unwrap it back to native token and notify your team.
