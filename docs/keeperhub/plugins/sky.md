# Sky Protocol

# Sky Protocol

Sky (formerly MakerDAO) is a decentralized protocol for stablecoin savings, governance, and token migration. This plugin exposes two ERC-4626 vaults (the sUSDS savings vault and the stUSDS staked vault), token balance and approval actions for USDS, DAI, and SKY, and converters for migrating legacy DAI to USDS and legacy MKR to SKY.

Supported chains: Ethereum (all contracts), Base (sUSDS, USDS), Arbitrum (sUSDS, USDS). Read-only actions work without credentials. Write actions require a connected wallet.

## Actions[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/sky#actions)

Sky is a multi-contract protocol, so actions are grouped below by the contract that exposes them. Each vault (sUSDS and stUSDS) is a standard ERC-4626 vault and exposes the same 18 vault actions; stUSDS uses a `st-usds-` slug prefix and a “stUSDS” label prefix to distinguish it from the sUSDS vault.

### Auto-Deposit Idle USDS into Savings[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/sky#auto-deposit-idle-usds-into-savings)

`Schedule (hourly) -> Sky: Get USDS Balance -> Math (Sum, divide by 1e18) -> Condition (> 500) -> Sky: Approve USDS Spending -> Sky: Vault Deposit`

Periodically check for idle USDS and automatically deposit into the sUSDS savings vault when the balance exceeds a threshold. Requires wallet connection.

### Track Savings Yield[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/sky#track-savings-yield)

`Schedule (daily) -> Sky: Vault Share Balance -> Sky: Convert Shares to Assets -> Math (Sum, divide by 1e18) -> Webhook: Send HTTP Request`

Monitor your sUSDS position, convert shares to their current USDS value, and send the result to an external webhook for portfolio tracking.

### DAI Migration Pipeline[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/plugins/sky#dai-migration-pipeline)

`Manual -> Sky: Get DAI Balance -> Math (Sum, divide by 1e18) -> Condition (> 0) -> Sky: Approve DAI Spending -> Sky: Convert DAI to USDS -> Sky: Vault Deposit`
