# Kh Workflow Update - KeeperHub Docs

## kh workflow update[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/cli/commands/kh_workflow_update#kh-workflow-update)

Update a workflow

### Synopsis[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/cli/commands/kh_workflow_update#synopsis)

Update a workflow.

Nodes and edges can only be supplied as a file. Unlike ‘kh workflow create’, there are no inline —nodes / —edges flags here.

The file is a JSON OBJECT holding both keys, not a bare array of nodes:

{“nodes”: \[…\], “edges”: \[…\]}

Both keys are sent together, so —nodes-file replaces the whole graph. To change one node, fetch the current definition first:

kh workflow get —json > workflow.json

Node config is only lightly checked on the way in. An integrationId that matches no integration is accepted (the API treats unknown ids as stale-but- savable references), and “network” and “actionType” are not validated at all. A successful update is not evidence that the workflow runs - misconfiguration surfaces at execution time.

```
kh workflow update <workflow-id> [flags]
```

### Examples[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/cli/commands/kh_workflow_update#examples)

```
  # Update workflow name
  kh wf update abc123 --name "New Name"

  # Update nodes from file - the file is an object, not an array:
  #   {"nodes": [ ... ], "edges": [ ... ]}
  kh wf update abc123 --nodes-file workflow.json

  # Assign the workflow to a project and tag
  kh wf update abc123 --project proj_123 --tag tag_456

  # Remove the workflow from its project (pass an empty value)
  kh wf update abc123 --project ""
```
