# Kh Chain List - KeeperHub Docs

## kh chain list[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/cli/commands/kh_chain_list#kh-chain-list)

List supported blockchain chains

### Synopsis[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/cli/commands/kh_chain_list#synopsis)

List supported blockchain chains.

Note the type change if you are copying a chain id into a workflow. This command reports “chainId” as a JSON number, but web3 workflow nodes expect config.network as a STRING:

kh chain list —json -> “chainId”: 103 workflow node config -> “network”: “103”

Writing the number form into a node config is accepted by the API and fails later at execution time, so it is worth getting right up front.

The list reflects the chains table in the target environment, which is seeded on deploy. It is the authoritative answer for which chains are live; the chain-config repo is only an input to that seed.

```
kh chain list [flags]
```

### Examples[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/cli/commands/kh_chain_list#examples)

```
  # List all chains
  kh ch ls

  # List chains as JSON
  kh ch ls --json

  # Chain id in the string form a workflow node config expects
  kh ch ls --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.name == "Solana Devnet") | .chainId | tostring'
```
