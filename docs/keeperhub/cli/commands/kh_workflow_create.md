# Kh Workflow Create - KeeperHub Docs

## kh workflow create[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/cli/commands/kh_workflow_create#kh-workflow-create)

Create a workflow

### Synopsis[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/cli/commands/kh_workflow_create#synopsis)

Create a workflow.

Nodes and edges can be supplied two ways, and the two take different shapes:

—nodes-file FILE a JSON OBJECT: {“nodes”: \[…\], “edges”: \[…\]} —nodes / —edges bare JSON ARRAYS, passed separately

Inline flags override the file when both are given. ‘kh workflow update’ accepts only —nodes-file, so a file is the portable choice if you intend to edit the workflow later.

New workflows are created DISABLED. There is no —enabled flag; enable the workflow in the web app, or PATCH “enabled”: true against the API directly.

Node config is only lightly checked on the way in. An integrationId that matches no integration is accepted (the API treats unknown ids as stale-but- savable references), and “network” and “actionType” are not validated at all. A successful create is not evidence that the workflow runs - misconfiguration surfaces at execution time.

```
kh workflow create [flags]
```

### Examples[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/cli/commands/kh_workflow_create#examples)

```
  # Create an empty workflow
  kh wf create --name "My Workflow"

  # Create with nodes from a JSON file - the file is an object, not an array:
  #   {"nodes": [ ... ], "edges": [ ... ]}
  kh wf create --name "DeFi Monitor" --nodes-file workflow.json

  # Create with inline JSON nodes - these flags take bare arrays
  kh wf create --name "Test" --nodes '[{"id":"t1","type":"trigger","position":{"x":0,"y":0},"data":{"type":"trigger","config":{"triggerType":"Manual"}}}]'

  # Create inside a project and label it with a tag
  kh wf create --name "Payouts" --project proj_123 --tag tag_456
```
