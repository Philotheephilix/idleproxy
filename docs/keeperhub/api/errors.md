# Error Codes

Reference for API error codes and how to resolve them.

## Error Response Format[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/errors#error-response-format)

Errors return a flat JSON envelope:

```
{
  "error": "invalid_input",
  "detail": "Human readable description of what went wrong",
  "request_id": "b3c1e2f0-2a4d-4a1e-9c3f-0f2b7c1d5e6a"
}
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `error` | Stable, machine-readable code (see below) |
| `detail` | Human-readable description of the failure |
| `request_id` | Correlation id, also echoed on the `x-request-id` response header |
| `hint` | Optional actionable next step (present on some errors) |
| `docs` | Optional link to relevant documentation (present on some errors) |

## HTTP Status Codes[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/errors#http-status-codes)

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | Success |
| 201 | Created |
| 400 | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized - Missing or invalid authentication |
| 403 | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| 404 | Not Found - Resource does not exist |
| 409 | Conflict - Idempotency-Key reused or request already in progress |
| 429 | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Internal Server Error |

## Error Codes[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/errors#error-codes)

The API uses a short set of stable, lowercase codes in the `error` field. Some routes add a more specific code (for example `WALLET_NOT_CONFIGURED` on execution routes); those are documented alongside the endpoint that raises them.

| Code | HTTP status | Meaning | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `unauthorized` | 401 | Missing or invalid authentication | Include a valid session cookie or API key |
| `insufficient_scope` | 403 | The session or key lacks the required scope | Use a key with the needed scope |
| `invalid_input` | 400 | Request validation failed | Check required fields and formats |
| `not_found` | 404 | Resource does not exist or is not visible to you | Verify the resource id |
| `conflict` | 409 | Request conflicts with the current state | Reconcile and retry |
| `rate_limited` | 429 | Too many requests | Back off and retry (see rate-limit headers below) |
| `internal_error` | 500 | Unexpected server error | Retry with backoff; contact support if it persists |

### Idempotency Errors[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/errors#idempotency-errors)

| Code | Description | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `idempotency_conflict` | The `Idempotency-Key` was reused with a different request body. Response includes `originalExecutionId`. | Use a new key for a different request |
| `idempotency_in_progress` | A request with this `Idempotency-Key` is still being processed | Retry shortly |

See [Direct Execution](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/direct-execution#idempotency) for the full idempotency policy.

### Workflow run failures[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/errors#workflow-run-failures)

Failures that occur while a workflow run executes, rather than while handling an API request, are surfaced in the run logs with a separate stable code of the form `PREFIX-NNNN` (for example `E-0001` for a run timeout). See [Run Error Codes](https://docs.keeperhub.com/keeper-runs/error-codes) for the full list.

## Rate Limiting[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/errors#rate-limiting)

A `rate_limited` error (HTTP `429`) means you have exceeded the request budget for the endpoint. Back off and retry using the rate-limit headers below.

#### Rate-limit headers[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/errors#rate-limit-headers)

Every response from a rate-limited endpoint (both success and `429`) carries the current limiter state, so clients can pace requests instead of guessing:

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests left in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix epoch (seconds) when the window frees a slot |
| `Retry-After` | Seconds to wait before retrying (sent only on `429`) |

Status and long-poll endpoints additionally return `X-Poll-Interval-Hint`: the server-recommended number of seconds to wait before polling again. A value of `0` means the resource has reached a terminal state and no further polling is needed.

> Anti-abuse endpoints (for example password reset and MFA enrollment) intentionally omit `X-RateLimit-Remaining` so they don’t disclose a caller’s remaining attempt budget. They still send `Retry-After` on `429`.

## Retry Strategy[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/errors#retry-strategy)

For transient errors (5xx, rate limits), use exponential backoff:

```
Wait time = min(base * 2^attempt, max_wait)
```

Recommended:

-   Base: 1 second
-   Max attempts: 5
-   Max wait: 30 seconds
