# What Your Transaction Looks Like On-Chain

# What Your Transaction Looks Like On-Chain

A workflow ran, KeeperHub reported success, and you opened a block explorer to check. What you see there depends on the network.

A write takes one of two shapes. On a gas-sponsored network the transaction is submitted by a relayer, so the sender is an address you do not recognise. On every other network, Tempo included, the transaction is sent by your own wallet and the sender is your own address. Both are normal. This page explains how to read each one.

## Which shape applies[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/onchain-appearance#which-shape-applies)

| Network | Shape |
| --- | --- |
| Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, and their testnets | Sponsored, when the [conditions](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/gas#when-a-transaction-is-sponsored) are met |
| Tempo | Sent from your own wallet |
| Any other network | Sent from your own wallet |

Sponsorship is conditional even on a supported network. If it does not apply to a given run, that transaction takes the direct shape instead.

## A sponsored write[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/onchain-appearance#a-sponsored-write)

Your wallet is not the account that submits the transaction. A relayer submits it on your behalf and pays the fee, and your action runs as an internal call inside it.

| Field | What you see | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| From | An address you do not recognise | The relayer that submitted and paid for the transaction |
| To | A contract you do not recognise | The contract that executes the call on your wallet’s behalf |
| Value | `0` | No native token is attached to the outer call |
| Status | Success | The transaction did what your workflow asked |

Your own action, the transfer or the contract call you configured, is an **internal call** inside that transaction rather than the top-level one.

## A write sent from your own wallet[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/onchain-appearance#a-write-sent-from-your-own-wallet)

| Field | What you see | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| From | Your own wallet address | Your wallet signed and submitted the transaction |
| To | The contract or recipient you configured | Your action is the top-level call |
| Value | `0` for a token transfer or contract call | Token movements are not native value; see below |
| Status | Success | The transaction did what your workflow asked |

Because your wallet is the sender, the transaction also appears in your wallet’s own transaction list on the explorer.

## Who pays the fee, and in what[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/onchain-appearance#who-pays-the-fee-and-in-what)

This is the part that differs most between networks.

**Sponsored.** The relayer pays the gas in the network’s native token. Your wallet’s native balance is unchanged by the fee, and the fee never appears as a debit against your address.

**Sent from your own wallet, on a network with a native token.** Gas comes out of your own native balance in the usual way.

**Sent from your own wallet, on Tempo.** Tempo has no native gas token. The fee is paid in a stablecoin from your own balance and appears as a token transfer inside the same receipt as your payment.

That last case is worth reading deliberately if you are doing agent accounting. Because the fee is denominated in the same stablecoin you are moving, cost and revenue arrive in one unit: you can read both off the same receipt and close the books without a conversion step. Keep a small stablecoin balance in the wallet so it can cover fees.

## Verify with the transaction hash, not your wallet address[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/onchain-appearance#verify-with-the-transaction-hash-not-your-wallet-address)

Use the `transactionHash` (or the explorer link) that KeeperHub reports for the run. Open that hash directly. It is the authoritative record on every network.

Do **not** verify by opening your wallet address and looking through its transaction list. A sponsored transaction was not sent by your wallet, so it does not appear there. The list will look as though nothing happened, even though the transaction succeeded.

On most explorers, the detail worth checking sits under the transaction’s **Logs**, **Internal Transactions**, or **Token Transfers** tabs. That is where your actual call, any token movements, and on Tempo the fee transfer appear.

## Why the value shows 0[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/onchain-appearance#why-the-value-shows-0)

`Value` is the amount of the chain’s native token attached to the top-level call. A token transfer moves an ERC-20 balance through a contract call, and a contract call usually attaches nothing, so both show `0` even though assets moved. This holds in both shapes. Check the token transfer list rather than the value field.

## Why your wallet may have code on it[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/onchain-appearance#why-your-wallet-may-have-code-on-it)

If you look up your organization wallet on an explorer, it may show a small amount of contract code rather than appearing as a plain address, and the explorer may label it as delegated or as a smart account.

That is expected. On supported networks the wallet is delegated so it can be operated on your behalf while remaining your wallet, under your address, holding your assets. The delegation is a one-time setup per network, not something each workflow repeats.

## Checklist[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/onchain-appearance#checklist)

If a run reports success but the chain looks wrong:

1.  Open the `transactionHash` from the run, not your wallet address.
2.  Confirm the status is Success.
3.  Look at Logs, Internal Transactions, and Token Transfers for the actual call.
4.  Check the sender against the shape for that network. On a sponsored network, expect a sender and a top-level contract you do not recognise. On Tempo and elsewhere, expect your own address.
5.  Expect a value of `0` for token transfers and contract calls either way.
