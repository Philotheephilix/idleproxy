# Address Book

# Address Book

The address book lets you save and label blockchain addresses that your organization uses frequently. Saved addresses are available across all workflows, so you do not need to copy and paste the same addresses repeatedly.

Address book entries are **organization-scoped** — every member of your organization can view and use them.

## Adding an Address[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/address-book#adding-an-address)

There are two ways to save an address:

**From the address book page**: Click **Add Address**, enter a label (for example, “Treasury Wallet”) and a valid Ethereum address, then click **Save**.

**From a workflow node field**: When you enter a valid address into any address-type field in the workflow builder, a **Save** button appears next to the input. Click it to open the save form with the address pre-filled. Provide a label and confirm.

Both methods validate the address format before saving. Invalid addresses are rejected with an error message.

## Editing an Address[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/address-book#editing-an-address)

Click the **Edit** icon next to any entry in the address book table. You can update the label, the address, or both. The address is re-validated on save.

## Removing an Address[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/address-book#removing-an-address)

Click the **Delete** icon next to any entry. The entry is removed immediately. Removing an address book entry does not alter workflow nodes that already reference that address — the address value remains in the node configuration.

## Checksummed Address Display[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/address-book#checksummed-address-display)

All addresses are stored in lowercase for consistency and displayed in **EIP-55 checksummed format**. This means mixed-case characters serve as a built-in integrity check, helping you verify that an address has not been corrupted.

When you copy an address from the address book, the checksummed form is copied to your clipboard.

## Address Book Entries in the API[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/address-book#address-book-entries-in-the-api)

The direct-execution API (`POST /api/execute/transfer`) validates `recipientAddress` with a strict EIP-55 checksum before accepting a request. Add recipients to the address book first and copy the checksummed form from here — or pass an all-lowercase address. A mixed-case address whose checksum does not match is rejected with `Invalid recipient address: <address>`. See [Direct Execution](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/direct-execution) for details.

The address book is also reachable over REST, so agents and integrations can maintain recipient allowlists without a human in the dashboard. The endpoints (`GET`/`POST /api/address-book`, `PATCH`/`DELETE /api/address-book/{entryId}`) are documented under [User](https://docs.keeperhub.com/api/user). Note that writes require the `mcp:write` scope: an unscoped `kh_` key is accepted, but a scoped key without that permission returns 403.

## Using Addresses in Workflow Nodes[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/address-book#using-addresses-in-workflow-nodes)

When you focus an address-type input field in the workflow builder, a **popover** appears showing your saved addresses. You can search by label or address, then select an entry to populate the field.

The selected bookmark is persisted in the node configuration. If you open the workflow later, the field retains its association with the address book entry.

## Block Explorer Links[](https://docs.keeperhub.com/wallet-management/address-book#block-explorer-links)

KeeperHub generates block explorer links for addresses and transaction hashes based on the selected network. Clicking an address or transaction hash link opens the relevant page on the network’s block explorer (for example, Etherscan for Ethereum Mainnet).

Explorer URL construction uses the chain’s configured `explorerUrl` and `explorerAddressPath`, so links work automatically for any supported network.
